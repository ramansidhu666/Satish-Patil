                        <p>Thank you for visiting this website.</p>
                        <p>Meet Satish Patil.</p>
                        <p>A graduate from the University of Mumbai, Satish migrated to Canada in 2000 and has ever since
called Mississauga home. He has witnessed the tremendous change and growth that’s transformed
the GTA area into one of the most sought-after places. He lives with his wife, two daughters and their
German Shepherd Rex.</p>
                        <p>He is a firm believer in giving back to the community and is passionate about animals and child
empowerment. “As the most intelligent species, the onus is upon us as humans to protect other
species who share this planet with us.” He also donates a portion of his commission to SickKids
Foundation and another charity for Girl Child Education.</p>
                        <p>Buying and selling real estate can be stressful and you need a realtor who’ll make your experience as
pleasurable as possible through timely communication and easy accessibility. “With that in mind, I’ve
been building my business based on dedication, communication, truthfulness, and trust.”</p>
                        <p>His passion for aviation led him to obtain his Commercial Pilot License and he occasionally goes
exploring around Southern Ontario.</p>
                        <p>Please call Satish anytime without obligation. He’s ready to go to work for you today!</p>
